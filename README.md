# DisableMapMaximize
An addon for World of Warcraft that disables the maximize button on the main map.

You can download the latest release via the Curse client or from https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/disable-map-maximize 

This simple addon disables the maximize button on the main map so that you can't accidentally click it when you're trying to close the map. 

It was originally a macro that I grabbed from a forum, but I would always forget to run the macro, so -boom- here it is as an addon.

You can activate/de-activate the effects of the addon via slash commands:

/dmm off     (turns the addon off)

/dmm on     (turns it on)


The setting is account-wide.

Enjoy!
